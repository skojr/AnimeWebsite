Welcome to my personal project!

## Directions to Use
1. Have React Vite and Spring Boot installed. The frontend code (React and Vite) was made in VS Code, and the backend code (Spring Boot) was created in IntelliJ IDEA.

### Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1. **Frontend**: Implemented with React and Vite. This branch contains the code for the user interface and client-side interactions.

2. **Backend**: Developed with Spring Boot. This branch contains the server-side logic, including user authentication and data handling.

Other branches:
1. **Token_auth**: Not necessary to use.
2. **No_token_auth**: Not necessary to use.

### Features
